thank you <3

Att2: To prevent lua executors, i really recomend some steps:
1 - Change _VerifyAntiAbuse code, to another hash or whatever 
2 - ofuscate your client side with 'load', with this way, nobody will know the code and can't execute the event.
3 - WEBSITE to ofuscte: https://glot.io/snippets/f1tt9okm5w attention: is not loadscript() anymore, now is load("string")()
